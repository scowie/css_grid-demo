# b2b-eslint

Standard eslint configuration utility for B2B Product Engineering

## Usage

First, install it as a dependency:

```sh
npm i --save-dev b2b-eslint
```

Next, configure your build process

*Webpack 1.x configuration:*

```js
const eslintConfiguration = require('b2b-eslint')

module.exports = {
  
  // configuration for eslint runtime
  eslint: eslintConfiguration,

  // preloader config to identify which code to lint 
  module: {
    preLoaders: [
      { test: /\.(js|vue|jsx)$/, loader: 'eslint-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ },
    ],
  }
}
```
Note: For production builds, always use `--bail` flag for webpack v1.x


*Gulp configuration:*

```js
```

## Intent

This linting standard is intended to help with static analysis of JavaScript applications in the B2B team in the form of an eslint configuration. 

The eslint configuration is purposely focused on highlighting JS anti-patterns and widely accepted best-practices. It is not intended to be a method of enforcing code styling or architectural best patterns.

The entirety of the eslint configuration can be found in `index.js`.

## Contribute

To contribute, simply update the eslint configuration exported from `index.js`. 

All changes must be accompanied by a pull-request and explanation of the reason for the change.
